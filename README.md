# Job-Posting-RSS
Job Posting RSS grabs data from the Job Posting Bethel site and scrapes each link for data. Then turns the data into an RSS feed, which is then processed by Campaign Monitor to send out emails when new jobs are added. This leverages the RSS automation functionality that Carlyle provides.
